# ART 387: The Manifesto

* Point value: 50 pts.
* Assigned: 25 March 2020
* Due: 3 April 2020

## Purpose

All bold art movements begin with a manifesto: a declaration of what an individual group believes to be true about a given art form (and, sometimes, what they believe _not_ to be true). In order for our distributed course to be evaluated for the remainder of the semester, this "manifesto" will serve as a way for the members of our architectural coterie to understand and interpret your work.

Keep in mind that this will be completed and shared under a pseudonym (or "code name") that will be revealed at the end of the remote semester. Think of this as a way to craft a spirit or persona that represents your view on the content that we've amassed so far.

## Supporting readings

* [Various manifestos](https://github.com/allegheny-college-art-387-spring-2020/course-materials/blob/master/Readings/Various%20-%20Manifestos%20Further%20Reduced.pdf)

For this assignment, you may feel free to choose a different manifesto than the one your group decided on before we left for Spring Break. Given the individual nature of how this semester likely needs to continue, all group projects are being transitioned to individual work.

## Activity

- [ ] Read the various manifestos included in the packet above
- [ ] Choose one to focus on which you believe _best_ models your approach to what architecture means to you
     * Research the author(s) and context of the manifesto
- [ ] Write your own manifesto which declares your interest and intent in this class for the remainder of the semester
     * Use the examples you've read as a guide for creating and giving form to your deliverable
 
## Deliverables

- [ ] A "code name" by which we will refer to your work for the remainder of the semester.
- [ ] A manifesto document in an appropriate form
    * Here, "document" and "form" are ambiguous and variable terms; this can take any form (video, audio, document, performance) which the you deem appropriate
- [ ] A 3 April submission of:
    * Background on the manifesto you chose from the packet. This background includes:
        * Your chosen "code name" at the top of this submission
        * 150 words about the author(s)
        * 1 example of a structure or work that the author includes or completed which you believe demonstrates the ideas of the manifesto
        * 150 words about the context the manifesto responds to
    * Your individual manifesto
        * Because these can take various forms which may or may not involve semantic ("word") content, there is no minimum length; however, given that these projects are intended to be complete arguments, I expect enough content to justify the choices made

## Evaluation

This project will be evaluated based on:
